    <p>
      To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy,
      or claim related to these Terms of Service (each a &quot;Dispute&quot; and
      collectively, the &ldquo;Disputes&rdquo;) brought by either you or us
      (individually, a &ldquo;Party&rdquo; and collectively, the
      &ldquo;Parties&rdquo;), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate
      any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally
      for at least
    </p>
    <p>
      thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations
      commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>Binding Arbitration</p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal
      negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below)
      will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU
      UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN
      COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and
      conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
      Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) and, where appropriate, the
      AAA&rsquo;s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes
      (&quot;AAA Consumer Rules&quot;), both of which are available at the AAA
      website www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator
      compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where
      appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are
      determined to by the arbitrator to be excessive, we will pay all
      arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted in person,
      through the submission of documents, by phone, or online.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a
      statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must
      follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator
      fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA
      rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in King County,
      Washington. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate
      in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or
      to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the
      arbitrator.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration,
      the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal
      courts located in King County, Washington, and the Parties hereby consent
      to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non
      conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and
      federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts
      for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information
      Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms of Service.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither
      Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of
      this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall
      be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed
      for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal
      jurisdiction of that court.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>Restrictions</p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute
      between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a)
      no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no
      right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action
      basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or
      authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative
      capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above
      provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (a)
      any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of,
      any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute
      related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of
      privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If
      this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party
      will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this
      provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be
      decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for
      jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal
      jurisdiction of that court.

      contract.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      * Legal Obligations: We may disclose your information where we are legally
      required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, governmental

    <p>4. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</p>
    <p>
      In Short: &nbsp;We keep your information for as long as necessary to
      fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise
      required by law.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary
      for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention
      period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other
      legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping

    </p>
    <p>
      When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
      information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if
      this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has
      been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
      information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>5. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</p>
    <p>
      In Short: &nbsp;We aim to protect your personal information through a
      system of organizational and technical security measures.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security
      measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we
      process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
      information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information
      storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot
      promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized
      third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly
      collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do
      our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
      information to and from our Website is at your own risk. You should only
      access the Website within a secure environment.
    </p>
    <p>6. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</p>
    <p>
      In Short: &nbsp;In some regions, such as the European Economic Area, you
      have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your
      personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at
      any time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some regions (like the European Economic Area), you have certain rights
      under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to
      request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to
      request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your
      personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In
      certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the
      processing of your personal information. To make such a request, please
      use the contact details (#contact) provided below. We will consider and
      act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information,
      you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note
      however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before
      its withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal
      information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than
      consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are a resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are
      unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right
      to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can
      find their contact details here:
      http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm.
    </p>

      If you are a resident in Switzerland, the contact details for the data
      protection authorities are available here:

    </p>
    <p>7. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</p>
    <p>
      Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
      applications include a Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting
      you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about
      your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no
      uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
      has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
      signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice
      not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted
      that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice
      in a revised version of this privacy notice.
    </p>

    <p>Verification process</p>
    <p>
      Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
      determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in
      our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide
      information so that we can match it with information you have previously
      provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we
      may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the
      information you provide with the information we already have on file, or
      we may contact you through a communication method (e.g. phone or email)
      that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other
      verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify
      your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we
      will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of
      verification. If, however, we cannot verify your identity from the
      information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide
      additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity, and
      for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such
      additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.
